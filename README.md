# Computer-Vision-Projects
Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects, showcasing various image processing and computer vision techniques. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced computer vision enthusiast, you'll find a range of projects to explore and learn from. 

# Projects Overview
1. Traffic Sign Recognition: An image classification project that recognizes and classifies different classes of traffic signs using deep learning techniques (a comparaison between KNN & MLP).


# Getting Started
Each project is organized in its respective directory. You can navigate to a project folder to find detailed documentation, code, and datasets specific to that project.


# Dependencies
Each project may have its specific dependencies. Check the project for details on the required libraries, packages, and installation instructions.

# License
Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code for your projects.

# Note
Everytime i finsih a project, it will be added here with the dataset used for that

Enjoy exploring the world of computer vision, and happy coding!
